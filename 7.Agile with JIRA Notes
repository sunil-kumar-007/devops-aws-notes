=> Backlog grooming is a meeting where all the team members will discuss about pending works/items in the project.

=> For every pending item we will create one story in the JIRA. Story means a task that we need to complete.

=> For every story we need to assign story points. Story points will represent duration to complete the story.

			3 points -> 1 day

			5 points -> 2 days

			8 points -> 3 days

Note: pending stories are called as backlog stories.

=> Sprint represents set of stories to complete in given duration.

Note: Sprint duration will be 2 weeks (industry standard)

=> In sprint duration, everyday scrum meeting will be there to give work updates to scrum master.
