IAM
=====

=> Identity and Access management

=> It is used to manage users, groups, policies and roles

=> IAM is free service

=> In AWS cloud platform we will have 2 types of accounts

		1) Root Account
		2) IAM Account

Note: When we signup in aws website then by default it will consider that as root account.

=> Root account is very powerfull account with no restrictions.

=> If we login with Root user credentials, we can access everything in AWS cloud.


Note-1 : We shouldn't use root account for day to day activities.

Note-2 : We shouldn't share root account credentials with anyone.

Note-3: Company will not provide root account credentials for team members

Note-4: It is recommended to enable MFA for root account.

		MFA : Multi Factor Authentication

===================================
Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)
===================================

-> It is used to provide additional security for root account.

-> Enable MFA for root account using Google Authenticator app.

-> After enabling MFA, logout and login into root account and check behaviour.
