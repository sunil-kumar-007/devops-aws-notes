######################################################################

1) What is IT infrastructure ?

2) Challenges with On-Prem infrastructure

3) What is Cloud Computing

4) Cloud Service Models

5) Cloud Providers

6) AWS Introduction

7) AWS Services Overview


=============================
What is IT Infrastructure ?
=============================

=> To run a software company then we need to purchase below resources

		a) machines
		b) network
		c) power
		d) storage
		e) backup
		f) security

=> The above resources are called as IT infrastructure.

=> We can maintain infrastructure in 2 ways

		a) On-Prem infrastructure		
		b) Cloud infrastructure

==================================
What is On-Prem Infrastructure ?
==================================

=> On-Prem means we need to purchase and we need to maintain our resources to run our business.

=> We have several challenges with On-Prem infrastructure

		1) Lot of money investement
		2) Lot of man power
		3) Scalability (increase / decrease)
		4) Availability
		5) Network issues
		6) Security issues

=> To overcome the problems of on-prem infrastructure companies are preferring Cloud Infrastructure.

==========================
What is Cloud Computing ?
===========================

=> The process of delivering IT resources over the internet on demand basis is called as Cloud Computing.

=> We have below advantages with cloud computing.

		- Pay as you go
		- Less cost
		- Scalability
		- Availability
		- Security
		- Backup

================
Cloud Providers
================

=> The companies which are providing IT infrastructure based on pay as you go model are called as Cloud Providers.

1) Amazon (AWS)

2) Microsoft (Azure)

3) Google (GCP)

4) Salesforce

5) Ali Baba

6) Digital Ocean....

=======================
Cloud Service Models
======================

=> We have 3 types cloud service models

1) IAAS

2) PAAS

3) SAAS

=============
What is IaaS
=============

=> IAAS stands for infrastructure as a service

=> Provider will give infrastructure for us

	Ex: Machines, Network, Storage

=> As a customer we need to prepare platform to run our application

  Ex: install required softwares + setup web servers + deploy application

=============
What is PaaS
=============

=> PaaS stands for Platform as a service

=> Provider will give ready made platform to run our application directley.

=> As a customer we need to take care of only our application deployment.

=================
What is SaaS
=================

=> SaaS stands for software as a service

-> Cloud Provider will give their application to run our business

  Ex: zoom, google drive, dropbox, microsoft teams, jira ...


===========
AWS Cloud  
=========== 

=> AWS stands for Amazon webservices.

=> AWS providing cloud services from 2006 onwards

=> AWS works based on Pay as you go model

=> 190+ countries using AWS cloud services to run their businesses

=> AWS having global infrastructure

		33 regions
		105 availability zones


========================
How to use AWS Cloud ?
========================

=> We can create free tier account in aws cloud for practice.

Note: If we use any paid service then bill be generated. AWS will not deduct bill amount from our card.

=> AWS will send reminders for bill payment. If we don't pay bill then our AWS account will suspended.

Note: We can request AWS support team to make bill amount as zero for 1 or 2 times.



===============
AWS Services
===============

=> We have 200+ Services.....

1) EC2  : To Create Virtual Machines (Hourly Billing)

2) S3 : Unlimited storage

3) RDS : Relational Database service

4) EFS : Elastic File System (shared file system)

5) IAM : Identity & Access Management

6) VPC : Virtual Private Cloud

7) Elastic Beanstack : End to end webapplication mgmt (PaaS)

8) Lambdas : Serverless computing

9) Route 53 : Domain Mapping (DNS)

10) ECS : Elastic Container Service

11) EKS : Elastic Kubernetes Service

12) Cloud Watch : Monitoring

13) SNS : Simple Notification Service .....


######################################################################
		Date: 27-July-2024
		Session: 03
		Topic: EC2
######################################################################

=> Elastic Compute Cloud

=> It is Most demanded service in AWS

=> It is Used to create Virtual Machines in AWS cloud

=> EC2 VM is called as EC2 instance

	EC2 Instance = Computer / Server / VM / Virtual Machine / V Box

=> EC2 instance is re-sizable (we can change configuration based on demand)

=> EC2 is a paid service (hourly billing)

=> EC2 VM Minimum billing period is 1 hour

			9:00 AM to 9:15 AM => 15 mins => 1 hour billing

			9:30 AM to 9:45 AM => 15 mins => 1 hour billing

Note: To encourage beginners, AWS provided t2.micro/t3.micro for 1 year free
 (monthly 750 hours)

=> EC2 VM will have storage with EBS service

				Ec2 VM with Windows OS : 30 GB (default)

				EC2 VM with Linux OS : 8 GB (default)

				EBS max capacity : 16 TB (16000 GB)

=> For EC2 instances network will be provided by VPC service.

=> For EC2 vm creation we will use AMI (Amazon Machine Image)

Note: AMI represents configuration required for machine

			- Windows AMI
			- Amazon Linux AMI
			- Ubuntu AMI
			- RedHAT AMI


=> To secure EC2 VM we will use Key-Pair (public key & private key)

=> To allow incoming and outgoing traffic for EC2 we will use Security Group

Note-1 : One Key Pair we can use for multiple EC2 instances

Note-2 : One Security Group (SG) we can use for multiple EC2 instances.

===========================
Lab Practicals on EC2 VM
===========================

1) Create Key Pair (.pem file)

		- public key (aws will keep it)
		- private key (we will get it)

2) Create Security Group and update Inbound Rules to allow traffic

		Windows RDP : 3389
		Linux SSH  : 22
		HTTP : 80
		HTTPS : 443
		MYSQL : 3306		

3) Create EC2 Instance

		- Select AMI (Windows AMI)
		- Select Instance Type
		- Select Key Pair
		- Select Security Group
		- Select EBS Volume
		- Launch Instance


4) Connect to EC2 instance using RDP client.
