AWS Lambdas
=============

-> AWS lambdas are used to achieve serverless computing.

-> Serverless computing means run the application without thinking about servers.

-> AWS will take care of servers required to run our application.

=> The main advantage of serverless computing is it works based on 'Pay as you use' model.

=> If your application code is executed then only bill be generated. If nobody accessing your application then no bill.


  code executed for only 5 mins : bill will generate only for 5 mins


==================================
Running Java Code with AWS Lambda
==================================

1) Create Lambda Function with 'java 21' runtime

	- Enable Functional URL
	- Auth Type None (Public Access)

Note: Once lambda function got created we can see URL to access that function.

2) Access Lambda function using its URL.

2) Upload jar file in 'Code Source'

3) Configure Handler in Runtime

		Class Name : in.ashokit.LambdaHandler

		Method Name : handleRequest

Handler Syntax : className :: methodName

Ex: in.ashokit.LambdaHandler::handleRequest

Static website deployment
===========================

Approach-1) S3 static website hosting

Approach-2) Take EC2 VM + Install HTTPD + Run Static website

============================
Dynamic Website Deployment
============================

Approach-1) Take EC2 VM Then install required softwares and run your application.

Approach-2) Elastic Beanstack (PaaS)

Approach-3) Lambdas (Serverless Computing)
