===================
What is Database ?
===================

Database : It is a software which is used to store the data permanently.

	Whatsapp Application -------------> Database

			- Text msgs
			- Audio files
			- Video files
			- Documents

=> Every s/w application will use database to store the data permanently.

=> Software applications will use SQL to communicate with databases.

=> SQL stands for Structured Query Language.

						    SQL
			Application ------------> Database

=> Using SQL we can perform CRUD operations in the database.

			C -> Create
			R -> Retrieve
			U -> Update
			D -> Delete			

=> We have several databases in the market
	
			- Oracle
			- MySQL
			- SQLServer
			- PostGres ....

=> The above databases are called as Relational Databases.

=> Relational databases will store the data using tables.

=> Table represents data using Rows and columns.	


=================
Database Setup
=================

=> We can setup database in 2 ways

		1) On-Prem Database

		2) Cloud Database

==================================
Challenges with On-Prem Database
==================================

1) Purchase DB server license

2) Install DB Server s/w

3) Security

4) Network

5) Availability

6) Scalability

7) Backup

8) Adminstration (DBA)	


=> To overcome above challenges it is highly recommended to use Cloud Database.

=> If we use cloud database then cloud provider will manage database server for us.

=> AWS RDS service providing cloud databases

=> RDS stands for relational database service in AWS cloud

=> RDS is used to create & manage relational databases

=> RDS is a fully managed service in AWS cloud.

=> RDS works based on "pay as you go" model.

RDS Lab Task
=============

Step-1 : Create MySQL DB Server using RDS

Step-2 : Enable MySQL :: 3306 port number in Security Group Inbound Rules

Step-3 : Test MySQL DB Connection using MySQL Workbench software (client s/w)

Step-4 : Execute some SQL queries for practice (optional)

Step-5 : Delete RDS instance to avoid billing.


============================
MySQL DB Creation Steps
============================

Creation method : Standard Create

Engine Type : MySQL

Templates: Free Tier

DB instance identifier : ashokit-db-instance 

public access : Yes

Database options : Initial DB name : sbidb


====================
Database Details
====================

DB Endpoint
DB username
DB password
DB port

Note : Using above details we can check database connectivity.

=> Once connectivity is successful then we will share database details with developmen team.


Master username : 

Master password : 

Endpoint : 

Note: Use MySQL Workbench and test database connectivitity. If you are able to connect that means your RDS Setup is successful.


============================
SQL Queries For Practice
============================

=> Execute below sql queries using workbench

show databases;
use sbidb;
show tables;

## table creation query
create table emp(
	eid int(10), 
	ename varchar(100), 
	esal int(10)
);

## retrieve records query
select * from emp;

## insert query
insert into emp values(1, 'john', 1000);
insert into emp values(2, 'smith', 2000);

select * from emp;



#### note: once practice completed, delete RDS instance ######

===========
Assigment
===========

1) Connect with RDS DB Server using EC2 Linux VM and execute above sql queries.
